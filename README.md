## My process

1. Do research about things that I didn't know from reading through the guideline.
2. Start HTML with semantic elements and try to make a layout that is easier to style with css later.
3. Start CSS after completing the first draft of HTML. 
4. Go back and forth to modify/update both files whenever necessary.
